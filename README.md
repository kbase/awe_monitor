awe_monitor
===========

Support for a pool of production awe clients

For support launching awe clients on remote machines, proper configuration of ssh keys is required. The native launch method uses ssh to launch a remote client. It assumes there is a script it can envoke on the remote machine. This script is specified in the deploy.cfg.
